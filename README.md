<h1 align='center'> TGV MAX WATCHER</h1>

[Live Website](https://tgv-max-weekends.netlify.app)

<h4>Website listing various trains to TGV Max availible destinations. TGV MAX (a monthly subscription that allows you to travel around France by train) is notoriously hard to find availible trains. This site allows you to see each availible (favourited or not) trip. A customisable bot runs twice a day to get the train list.</h4>

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
